    <h5>Shelby Franklin Da'turtle</h5>
    <p> This is Shelby, one of the only teenagers you will meet who not only eats broccoli but begs for it. He loves all foods green. Even better, if you want to bond with Shelby, feed him apple jacks out of the palm of your hand.

    <h5>Crumb</h5>
    <p> This is Crum. His full name is Crumbles. He is quite an interesting crab. He doesn't like to use his legs, so he drags himself around with his little arms.

    <h5>Socrates</h5>
    <p> This is Socrates. Despite his interest in discourse, he tends to be a bit late to his own dialectic gatherings. You see, as a young sloth, it takes him quite some time to cross the road. He gets to the median, then needs to wait another light cycle before he can cross the rest of the way.</p>

    <h5>Pillsbury</h5>
    <p> This is Pillsbury, the only permanent catepillar you will find. He never turns into a butterfly, and he is perfectly ok with that. He spends most of his time breezing through books and articles. He has a taste for fiction, but will entertain some informative content about nature.</p>
