    <h1>Odin Stuffed Animals</h1>
    <h3>This is a project about stuffed animals. One day, they will rule the world.</h3>

    <h5>Owli Bobeanie Da'owl</h5>
    <p> This is Owli, the most intelligent 3 year old you will ever meet. While she is quite learned and surely a very wise owl, she has a bit of a speech inpeppermint.</p>

    <h5>Beary Berenstain Da'bear</h5>
    <p> This is Beary, a 25 year old bear. Despite his age, his appearance makes him look much younger. He spends a lot of his time helping to take care of the other stuffed animals. Being a caretaker comes naturally to him. He is a very stable force in the stuffie family.</p>

    <h5>Shelby Franklin Da'turtle</h5>
    <p> This is Shelby, one of the only teenagers you will meet who not only eats broccoli but begs for it. He loves all foods green. Even better, if you want to bond with Shelby, feed him apple jacks out of the palm of your hand. He is a 15 year old turtle, but doesn't have the same behavioral issues that tend to come with teenagers.</p>

    <h5>Crumb</h5>
    <p> This is Crum. His full name is Crumbles. He is quite an interesting crab. He doesn't like to use his legs, so he drags himself around with his little arms. He enjoys a nice dunk in some canola oil. He is obsessed with bombs and other weapons. If you say anything to Crumb, he will likely only respond with screaming about bombs. He keeps the stuffed animals well guarded. </p>

    <h5>Socrates</h5>
    <p> This is Socrates. Despite his interest in discourse, he tends to be a bit late to his own dialectic gatherings. You see, as a young sloth, it takes him quite some time to cross the road. He gets to the median, then needs to wait another light cycle before he can cross the rest of the way.</p>

    <h5>Pillsbury</h5>
    <p> This is Pillsbury, the only permanent catepillar you will find. He never turns into a butterfly, and he is perfectly ok with that. He spends most of his time breezing through books and articles. He has a taste for fiction, but will entertain some informative content about nature.</p>

    <h5>Pixel</h5>
    <p> This is Pixel, a loyal german shepard. He loves going to the dog park to play with his puppy friends. He likes to take them under his paw and teach them. He loves to be cuddled with. Despite his loving nature towards his owner, he will defend his owner against any threats. Being kind to him and his owner will prevent any issues.</p>
